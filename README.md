# CV-Request-Website
Within this assignment you will be asked to create several webpages performing set tasks.  Practical classes will be an integral part of the preparation for the assignment submission.

The landing page (image_map.html) will consist of an image map in which you have employed CSS3 to link to two pieces of your work: your web_form.html and your key_features.pdf.

Contact Form - web_form.html
		The purpose of this web page is to collect contact details of potential employers who have requested your Curriculum Vitae (CV). You are 			required to use your knowledge of UX design and apply the principles to develop a suitable HTML5 structure adding the FORM elements you 			think match the needs for the scenario including appropriate accessibility features and the code necessary for validation of user input.  		(Intrinsic HTML5 validation must be supplemented with JavaScript.)
		On submission of contact details by someone from a company interested in viewing your CV the web page will supply either short-form and 			long-form versions of your CV, based on the version they requested. It is to display a table of the company names who have visited the page 		to-date requesting copies of your CV.  It should also include the number of times the page has been viewed as well as the number of unique 		 views.  Your webpage should act as a showcase of your interactive web authoring skills to prospective employers.
		You should consider carefully what pieces of information you report in the table to account for GPDR requirements.

Key Features Report – key_features.pdf
		The Key Features Report should provide a commentary on the code you have developed for your web page. It should highlight and prioritise no 		more than six features you consider to be most important in the presentation and control of your page and provide a brief commentary on the 		implementation of each.
		The Key Features Report should be developed in Word and the final version printed to PDF format with the filename key_features.pdf. The 			report should conform to the following document structure:
		Title –	CV Showcase Web Page - Six Key Design Features and their Implementation
		Author –	Your B00-code, Name and Course
		Identification of the six key design features, in order of importance, with justification of your choice.  Commentary on the implementation 		of each chosen key feature should be provided, supported with appropriate code snippets. (500 words maximum, not including code snippets).
		References (in Harvard format)
		Three Appendices with titles: HTML, CSS and JavaScript, each with the relevant code are required, appropriately indented, styled using http://highlight.hohli.com/index.php and commented.
